# Description
The MoLE-EN can be used to derive the MoLE-Lasso and MoLE-RR as well. First, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha = 1"> is considered to derive the MoLE-Lasso, then <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha = 0.5"> is used to derive the MoLE-EN, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha = 0"> is used to derive the MoLE-RR.

# Source Code
The source code presents the main class for MoLE-EN. The source code is provided in Matlab format. The usage is quite simple. Below an example.

First, you need to define the following paramaters first
```matlab
lambda=1e-3 % is the default;



```
